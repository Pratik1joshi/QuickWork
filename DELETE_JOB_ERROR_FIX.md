# ðŸ”§ Delete Job Feature - Error Fix

## âœ… **Issues Identified and Fixed:**

### **Error 1: Missing Database Column**
```
Could not find the 'completed_at' column of 'jobs' in the schema cache
```

**Fix Applied**: Removed `completed_at` and `cancelled_at` from update queries since these columns don't exist in the current schema.

### **Error 2: Profile Reading Error**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'profile')
```

**Fix Applied**: This was caused by the database update failure. Should be resolved now.

## ðŸ”§ **Current Working Implementation:**

### **DeleteJobButton & QuickDeleteButton**
- âœ… **No hired workers**: Direct delete with confirmation
- âœ… **Has hired workers**: Ask "Is work completed?" â†’ Mark as completed â†’ Delete
- âœ… **Uses only existing database columns**: `status` field only
- âœ… **Proper error handling**: Catches and displays meaningful errors

### **Database Operations:**
1. **Mark as completed** (if needed): `UPDATE jobs SET status = 'completed'`
2. **Delete applications**: `DELETE FROM job_applications WHERE job_id = ?`
3. **Delete job**: `DELETE FROM jobs WHERE id = ?`
